# Course-Tracker-v2
Java full stack web app using Spring Boot and Vaadin FLow, all the sample data is per usual taken from the following TV Show: Blackadder Goes Forth
Please not that the web app is utilized for my side-hustles. The idea is that the Course-Tracker can be used for tracking all sorts of the course-lesson-student-transaction type work. Be it programmings lessons adn tutorage or Sailing Instructions
### ReadME is WIP but the code is somewhat finalized
